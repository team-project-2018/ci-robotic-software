Firstly, Docker is a platform that consists of
  - Docker Engine
      Which is a poweful, lightweight open source containerization technology.      
  - Docker Hub
      Which is a Software as a Service for managing and sharing application stacks.


Docker offerst a tool called "Compose" for defining and running complex applicatons, such as:
  - docker-compose build  : run if you change a service
  - docker-compose up     : builds, creates, starts and attached to containers
  - docker-compose down   : stops and removes containers created by 'up'
  - docker-compose exec   : run arbitrary commands
  - docker-compose create : which creates containers for a service
  - docker-compose ps     : lists containers
  - docker-compose stop   : stops running conatiners, but does not remove them
  - docker-compose kill   : forces to stop the running containers
  - docker-compose rm     : removes stopped containers
  - docker-compose images : lists images that are beeing used
  - docker-compose push   : pushes images
  - docker-compose pull   : pulls images
  - docker-compose restart: restarts docker compose services
  - docker-compose start  : starts existing containers
  
  
Docker can also be used in swarm mode, which we chose and ecexuted. This is used to natively manage a cluster of docker Engines. 
We created a swarm (more than once), deployed the application and managed it's behavior.
  - docker swarm join ... : used to join the  newly created swarm 
  - docker swarm leave    : used to leave the old swarm when joining a new one
  


Kubernetes is by definition an open source container orchestration system for:
automating deployment, scaling and managment of containeraized applications
